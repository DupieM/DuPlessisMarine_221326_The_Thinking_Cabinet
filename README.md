<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* `Expo` was used to create a native Android app
* `OpenAI` was used to get insights on their carbon footprint data
* `Google Custom Search` was used to get reducing tips in general and for their total emission data
* `QuickChart` was used to display all the data on charts

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* To be able to implement two different types of AI 
* To be able to activate the forgot password to send a link to users email to reset it
* To be able to work natively on my computer and seeing the results on the mobile application

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Trying to find the correct calculation to be able to calculate a Carbon Footprint for an individual 
* When using the calculation it was challenging to understand and use the correct units of measure
* Implementing the two types of AI for the insights and custom search, especially understand how to use these technologies
* Creating another subcollection in an already existing subcollection in Firebase

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->
