## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
<img src="" alt="header image" width="580px">

### Project Description

The Thinking Cabinet is an interactive digital platform that fosters reflective thinking and self-exploration. Users can upload meaningful object images, engage with AI to explore their significance, and generate thought-provoking responses. Alternatively, they can select predefined objects to instantly create stories or explore categorized themes through AI-driven conversations for inspiration, reflection, or curiosity.
